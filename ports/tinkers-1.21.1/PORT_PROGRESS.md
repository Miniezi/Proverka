# Unfinished TConstruct 1.21.1 NeoForge port

No playable JAR is available. Full compilation still fails.

Verified in Actions run 38161288525: pinned Mantle builds; the isolated display-context server fixture passes all six migrated contexts. The fixture is not the full mod.

Current fixes: identifier-boundary API renaming, preservation of project-owned FrameType, correct BiomeModifiers API name, Mantle ingredient loadables. Preparation validates public type filenames to catch accidental renaming.

Remaining major work: recipe codecs, item data components, capabilities, network payloads, GUI APIs, dynamic enchantment registries and access transformers. Client and full-mod gameplay tests have not run. Error counts include cascading failures and are not a completion percentage.
